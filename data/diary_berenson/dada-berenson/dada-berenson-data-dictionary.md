## Definitions:<br/>
**Precision** = "Number of "correct" results divided by number of all returned results"<br/>
**Recall** = "Number of "correct" results divided by number of results that should have been returned."<br/>

Precison / Recall **Level A**: Where "Correct" = All Matches (Exact + Partial)<br/>
Precison / Recall **Level B**: Where "Correct" = Only Exact Matches<br/>
Precison / Recall **Level C**: Where "Correct" = Only Exact Matches with Correct Type Match

## Percentage Calculations<br/>
[Precision A](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-ner-evaluation/blob/master/data/diary_berenson/dada-berenson/precision-a.csv) Calculation = Matched Entities ÷ Matched Entities (does not yield useful results)<br/>
[Precision B](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-ner-evaluation/blob/master/data/diary_berenson/dada-berenson/precision-b.csv) Calculation = Exact Entities ÷ Matched Entities<br/>
[Precision C](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-ner-evaluation/blob/master/data/diary_berenson/dada-berenson/precision-c.csv) Calculation = Exact Entities with Correct Type Match ÷ Matched Entities

[Recall A](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-ner-evaluation/blob/master/data/diary_berenson/dada-berenson/recall-a.csv) Calculation = Matched Entities ÷ All Marked-Up Entities<br/>
[Recall B](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-ner-evaluation/blob/master/data/diary_berenson/dada-berenson/recall-b.csv) Calculation = Exact Entities ÷ All Marked-Up Entities<br/>
[Recall C](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-ner-evaluation/blob/master/data/diary_berenson/dada-berenson/recall-c.csv) Calculation = Exact Entities with Correct Type Match ÷ All Marked-Up Entities
